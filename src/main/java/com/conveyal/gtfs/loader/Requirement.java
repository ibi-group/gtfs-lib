 *
 * TODO: These enum values should be placed in an ordered list or assigned order constants, which allow a generic
 * filtering predicate that returns true for elements "up to and including" a supplied level. Currently, this has a
 * fragmented implementation in {@link Table#editorFields()} and {@link Table#specFields()}. However, it is currently
 * unclear what the levels.order for the types EXTENSION, PROPIETARY, and UNKNOWN ought to be.
